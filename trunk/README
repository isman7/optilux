WHAT?

Optilux is an open source collection of tools that provide advanced techniques
to design, simulate, and analyze optical communication systems. Optilux is 
implemented as a Matlab/Octave toolbox and efficiently exploits the MEX
interface to speed up computation.  The toolbox includes routines to describe
and analyze many aspects of optical systems, including:

    * Bit pattern generators 
    * Multi-level modulation formats 
    * WDM transmission 
    * Optical fibers in the nonlinear regime 
    * Karhunen-Loeve methods for performance evaluation 
    * Monte Carlo estimation 
    * Polarization effects

Optilux is released under the GNU General public licence, version 3.

===============================================================================
INSTALLATION

The installation is simple: copy the directory where you like, e.g.
/home/user/mydir/optilux, and add it to the Matlab/Octave path, for instance by
entering the following statement under Matlab/Octave:

addpath /home/user/mydir/optilux

The speed of the code can be increased by compiling the *.c files within the 
optilux directory using the MEX interface.	
The compilation can be done by running:

mex filename.c

or, alternatively, by using comp_mex.m that is inside the optilux package.

NOTE: The compilation of .c files can fail because Matlab is unable to find
the correct c++-standard-library. In this case edit your mexopts.sh file
(you can create it in ~/.matlabxx/mexopts.sh by running mex -setup in Matlab)
and replace the line:

CLIBS="$RPATH $MLIBS -lm -lstdc++"

by, (e.g. if you have Matlab in /opt)

CLIBS="$RPATH $MLIBS -lm /opt/matlab/sys/os/glnx86/libstdc++.so.5"

Another solution under Debian-based Linux systems is to run the following: 

apt-get install build-essential 

This package contains an informational list of packages which are considered 
essential for building Debian packages.

USAGE

Each function has its detailed help. Start by run the examples in the
subdirectory examples/.


Have fun
